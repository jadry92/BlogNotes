A few days ago talking with a friend how is a game developer, I asked him "how do get inspired to create new things?", he just answers "I just create something that other has already done" :astonished: . I thought "Wow simple but true".

:bulb:"E-commerce example with Django":bulb:

This idea comes to me because I've been studying Django for the last 3 weeks.
As I see this could be a BIG and challenging project to me because my experience with Django is small.

First, I'm going to start reading about E-commerce and its structure. Also, I believe there are and other projects like this so I'll check it and try to find one to don't start from zero.

In this [link](https://github.com/jadry92) will be hosted the code of the idea.

... in construction ...
