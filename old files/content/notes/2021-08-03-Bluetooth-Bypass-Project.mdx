title: 'Bluetooth Bypass Project'
date: 2021-08-03

This project is to create a bypass in bluetooth to reproduce music on my car.

My car is a Ford Fiesta 2012 which magically has bluetooth connection **Only For Calls**. This makes me disappointed, but I think at the time when the car was manufactures, Music Reproduction on phones it wasn't a common reality.

To fix this I think I can create an app to bypass the music as call... It's possible I don't know, there's already a solution for this, I don't know either. Let See.

To Do :

- [x] Search for solutions
- [ ] ~~Create a Electron APP to start understand the Bluetooth API~~
- [x] Research about React Native to create the app
- [x] Creating setup to develop mobiles APPs
- [x] Create a React Native "Hello World"
- [] Start play with the Bluetooth API

#### Solution 1 : "Update Software of the car"

I researched about it and it's not an easy task. I will need to get a cable to connect with the car computer.
Yes, there is not a easy update the Ford stereo software.

#### Solution 2 : "Apps already made"

There is tons of Android Apps for bluetooth features but nothing that I'm looking for.

#### Solution 3 : "Make an App to fix the problem"

I'm going to choose this because I think it's the "easiest" way to fix this.

I will use React Native because I have a bit of knowledge on React.js.

#### Setting up Development Env

I followed https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup, the have to ways to setup your env. The easy is **Expo CLI** which it's a tool to develop React Native APP. An the normal one which is installing the **React Native CLI**.

I installed the normal which involved install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), And [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

After a study for a while React Native, I found enough knowledge to start with the solution for my problem. The repository for the code will be on [link]()

The first step is to understand how work with Bluetooth in Android, for that I will use the library [BTL](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) created by Polidea.
