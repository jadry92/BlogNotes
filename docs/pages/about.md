I'm a technology enthusiastic who believe in the democratization of education. Also a geek passionate about technology and in love with science. I studied a bachelor of science and electronics engineering, when I developed a huge interest in processors and software. I have had the opportunity to develop complex algorithms with technologies like CUDA-C, Open-CL, Javascript, Python and Linux. I'm goal-oriented, curious and collaborative, and enjoy working in a team. I'm also very good at explaining the background of technology and passionate about passing on my knowledge.
