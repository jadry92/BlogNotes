Tangram is a dissection puzzle that has seven pieces which you could imitate
figures like this one

The idea is to implement a Genetic Algorithm which solves the puzzle for specific images.

My First idea of implementation is using [P5.js](https://github.com/jadry92).
I think [P5.js](https://github.com/jadry92) could be an easy way to develop this idea
because is an easy framework to animate ideas.

The beta of this idea will develop in this [link](https://github.com/jadry92).

.... in construction ...
