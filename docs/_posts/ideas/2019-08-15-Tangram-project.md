Tangram is a dissection puzzle that has seven pieces which you could imitate figures like this one [Wiki][1]

The idea is to implement a Genetic Algorithm which solves the puzzle for specific images.

My First idea of implementation is using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/). I think [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) could be an easy way to develop this idea because is an easy framework to animate ideas.

The beta of this idea will develop in this [link](https://github.com/jadry92).

.... in construction ...
