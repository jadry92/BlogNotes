Today I heard “ideas are intangible and without making them real have no value”. This phrase makes sense to me, a person who wants to become a tech creator (software/hardware developer). Because of this today and the coming days I will share all the ideas that I get or that I watch on the internet. Maybe some of you can make it real and learn something new or solve a problem or maybe become rich “Lol”. Some of them I will explain in detail.

Ideas:
- Notes interactive in Twitch.
- A Open source Tax Assistant.
- Image to ASCII image.
- Open Source Auto-reference from Web-Pages.
- A dynamic image of subnetting.
- An easy router explanation.
- E-commerce from scratch.
- Cash flow CLI application.
- [Genetics algorithms solve a Tangram]({% post_url 2019-08-15-Tangram-project %}).

In future entrances I will explain each of these ideas in detail.
