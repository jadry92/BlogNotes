This project is to create a bypass in bluetooth to reproduce music on my car. 

<!--more-->

My car is a Ford Fiesta 2012 which magically has bluetooth connection **Only For Calls**. This makes me disappointed, but I think at the time when the car was manufactures, Music Reproduction on phones it wasn't a common reality.

To fix this I think I can create an app to bypass the music as call... It's possible I don't know, there's already a solution for this, I don't know either. Let See.

### Entry -- 03/08/2021

To Do :
- [x] Search for solutions
- [ ] Create a Electron APP to start understand the Bluetooth Low Energy API
- [ ] Research about React Native to create the app

#### Solution 1 : "Update Software of  the car"

I researched about it and it's not an easy task. I will need to get a cable to connect with the car computer. 
Yes, there is not a easy update the Ford stereo software.

#### Solution 2 : "Apps already made"

There is tons of Android Apps for bluetooth features but nothing that I'm looking for.
