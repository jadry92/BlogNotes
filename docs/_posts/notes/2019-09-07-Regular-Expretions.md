"Regular Expressions are the key tools that all Developer should have in their pocket", it's the phrase with the teacher Alberto Alcocer repat constantly in the course in Platzi.

A Regex (Regular Expression) is a patter which is possible to filter strings without using a lot of resources. Regexes are commonly used to filter URL, phone numbers, emails and so on:
Example:
String: 
```
Hello
```



```
. -> whatever ca racter
\w - > find any conjunct that looks like as word
\d - > find all the digits
\s - > spaces in blank
[0-9] ~ \d
[0-9a-zA-Z_] ~ \w
.* -> greedy all
+ -> one or more
? -> zero or one
```
