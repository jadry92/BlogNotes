Use genetics algorithms to solve a Tangram puzzle.

Tangram is a dissection puzzle that has seven pieces which you could imitate figures like this one [Wiki][1]

The idea is to implement a Genetic Algorithm which solves the puzzle for specific images.

My First idea of implementation is using javascript with [P5.js][1] library. [P5.js][1] could be an easy way to develop this idea because it is an easy framework to create animations.
Genetic algorithms

“A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA)” [wiki][3].

### The steps of a GA is:

- Define a goald or cost funtion.
- Define a first generation “Xn” of solutions.
- Check each of the solutions with the cost function “F” that wants to optimize.
- Combine each of the solutions to create the second generation, these combinations are based on the value “F(Xn)”.

### In programing words:

```
X = [x1,x2,x3,x4, …, xn ] # First generation of solution
function cost_function(x){
	asdas
}
S = [s1,s2,s3, …, sn] # Solution value vector
Function combination(S, X){
	asdasd
}
```

The beta of this idea will develop in this [repo](https://github.com/jadry92) and the documentation is [here]().

### challenges :

1. Create the vector of solutions.
2. Create the cost function
3. Add new goals to the algorithm.
4. ...
