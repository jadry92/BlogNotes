All my life I've been passionate about technology, every time that I see a new
gadget I ask myself "how does it work?", "Why this designed?", "Why is it so
expensive?". But more of the times I've just watched these devices in Youtube
video or blog post because it's not affordable to me.

But, I was thinking about to create a command-line tool (CLI) for Unix and
Linux to scraper date from all Australia tech-sell pages such as Office works,
JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman. My first idea is using a Python library for CLI
sort of "argparse", "click", "fire", etc.

The command could be :

```Bash
NAME
  find-product -- find the price of a specific product
DESCRIPTION
  The find-product utility search in all
  pages that are listed in the config files

  The options are as follows:

  -name [name]
        The name of the product that I want to find.
```

This could be the first version of the description file in de CLI. The repository is in this [link](https://github.com/jadry92).
