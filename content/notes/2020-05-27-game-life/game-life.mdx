A few days ago, I saw this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPtKv9fSHZY) "it's in Spanish" about **Game of Life Conway** which show this idea of a simple "game" created by [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway). Which simulate a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).

To me, this is not a usual game because there is no way to win or end goal.
And it doesn't need any player.
I would say it's a simulation of a grid life.
The idea of this simulation is to have a grid "2D matrix" with cells of
1s and 0s. Where a cell with one means alive and a cell with zero means
dead. Then, apply two simples rules in the grid to calculate a
new grid in the next time frame:

- **Rule 1:**: if the cell is dead and there are three cells a life close, will be revived
- **Rule 2:**: if the cell is alive and there are less than two or more than three cells alive, will be died

But the amazing fact of this game is that represents a [turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

In the tutorial, he creates a python solution of the game using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org). I followed the video and replicate my [version](https://github.com/jadry92/conway-s-game-of-the-life). But I decided to go forward and create an implementation in javascript to embed in a web page.

<div

  class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center"

Both implementations are in this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/jadry92/conway-s-game-of-the-life)
